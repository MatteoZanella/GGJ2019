This game is about an old man, a scientist, in a retirement home. He wants to escape and go back to his home, but he has alzheimer. Alzheimer doesn't let him remember where did he go(Randomness of levels and generation in real time). Nurses try to stop him until his angery gets high and he stops(Fail).

### Technology Notes: 

Special thanks to Unity for game development, Blender for assets creation and git (Github) for version control. Thanks Reddit for free dancing VRChat assets. The game isn't fully updated yet. We need to add the randomness ingame (not only during the level gen). We need also to ultimate the victory section. Actually it's a free roam.
